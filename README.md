Description: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a persistent neurological disorder with almost no current cure, although available
medications can mitigate its progression. The timely identification and staging of AD is pivotal in impeding
and managing its advancement. This study aims to develop a comprehensive framework for the early detection of AD and the classification of medical images across four AD stages. We have proposed a weighted
ensemble deep transfer learning framework using two pretrained CNN architectures, namely ResNet152V2
and DenseNet201. Additionally, gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) is utilized to enhance
interpretability by capturing gradients associated with AD in brain MRI images, propagating them to the final
convolutional layer. This technique narrows the interpretability gap in deep learning models, enhancing accessibility and understanding of their decision-making processes, particularly in the context of AD diagnosis. Two
different MRI datasets have been used to train and evaluate the performances of the proposed framework
focusing on generalization capability with diverse data. The performances of the framework are analyzed
meticulously under different case studies. The experimental results demonstrate that the weighted ensemble
architecture exhibits superior performance characteristics over base models showing accuracy of 98%, which
is compatible with related state of the art algorithms.
